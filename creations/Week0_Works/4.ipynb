    "# Introduction to Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models (LMs) become far more powerful when combined with external tools.  \n",
    "Tools are central to enabling LMs to perform actions autonomously. By granting an LM access to tools, you provide it with a form of autonomyâ€”allowing it to query databases, perform calculations, or even send messages to other LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this concept might feel complexâ€”or even unsettling. The idea of an AI model querying your database or remotely controlling devices can sound like science fiction.  \n",
    "However, in reality, tool calling is **structured, simple, and practical**.\n"

    "## How Tool Calling Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling allows an LM, such as GPT-4, to request the execution of external functions or tools while generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt with Available Tools** â€“ The LM is shown a list of available tools (e.g., SQL queries, calculators, APIs).\n",
    "2. **LM Requests a Tool** â€“ If needed, the LM responds in JSON format specifying the tool and parameters.\n",
    "3. **Execution by Code** â€“ Your code interprets the JSON, executes the requested action, and retrieves the result.\n",
    "4. **Result Returned to LM** â€“ The result is passed back, and the LM integrates it into the final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually implemented with simple conditional logic (e.g., `if` statements) inside your codebase.\n"
