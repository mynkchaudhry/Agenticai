    "# AI Agents and LLM Workflow Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the concept of **AI Agents** and explores the five major **workflow design patterns** for building systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).  \n",
    "The content is structured in a **Q&A format** for clarity, with detailed explanations, key characteristics, and practical examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question  \n",
    "**What are AI Agents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer  \n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Agents** are intelligent software programs powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** that can **reason, plan, and take actions**.  \n",
    "Unlike simple chat models that only generate text, AI Agents are capable of:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning tasks** → Identifying the steps required to achieve a goal.  \n",
    "- **Calling tools and APIs** → Using external systems such as search engines, databases, or calculators.  \n",
    "- **Managing actions** → Executing workflows, monitoring progress, and adapting based on feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, AI Agents combine **language understanding** with **decision-making and action execution**, enabling them to solve real-world problems autonomously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of AI Agents  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous** → Can act without step-by-step human supervision.  \n",
    "- **Goal-Oriented** → Focused on reaching a defined objective.  \n",
    "- **Tool-Using** → Can interact with APIs, software, and data sources.  \n",
    "- **Adaptive** → Adjust steps based on context or feedback.  \n",
    "- **Workflow-Aware** → Break down and manage multi-step processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example  \n",
    "\n",
    "**User Request:**  \n",
    "“Book me a flight to Delhi next week for under $200.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How an AI Agent responds:**  \n",
    "1. **Plan** → Identify required steps: search flights → filter → compare → book.  \n",
    "2. **Call Tools** → Query a flight search API.  \n",
    "3. **Evaluate** → Check results against price and schedule constraints.  \n",
    "4. **Act** → Reserve the best option and confirm the booking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that an AI Agent is not limited to text generation.  \n",
    "It operates as a decision-maker and executor of actions in a workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: LLM Workflow Design Patterns  \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are often combined into **workflows** to improve efficiency, accuracy, and control.  \n",
    "Anthropic identifies **five major workflow design patterns** commonly used when building generative AI systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prompt Chaining  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A sequence of LLM calls where the output of one step becomes the input of the next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- LLM 1 → Selects a business sector.  \n",
    "- LLM 2 → Identifies a pain point.  \n",
    "- LLM 3 → Suggests a solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- Breaks a complex task into smaller, well-defined subtasks.  \n",
    "- Provides structure and keeps the process on guardrails.  \n",
    "- Flexible: can use any number of chained LLMs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Routing  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "An LLM acts as a “router,” deciding which specialized model should process the input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Router receives a query.  \n",
    "- Sends math problems → Math-specialist LLM.  \n",
    "- Sends legal questions → Legal-specialist LLM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- Efficient use of specialized expertise.  \n",
    "- Input classification handled by the router LLM.  \n",
    "- Provides autonomy within controlled boundaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Parallelization  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A task is divided into multiple subtasks and executed simultaneously.  \n",
    "Here, **code (not an LLM)** controls task splitting and result aggregation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Summarizing a 5-chapter book.  \n",
    "- Each chapter sent to a different LLM in parallel.  \n",
    "- Results combined into one summary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- Improves efficiency by running tasks concurrently.  \n",
    "- Can repeat the same task for robustness (e.g., majority voting).  \n",
    "- Aggregation handled programmatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Orchestrator-Worker  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "An **LLM orchestrator** manages the workflow by assigning subtasks to **worker LLMs** and synthesizing their outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Orchestrator LLM splits essay into: introduction, body, conclusion.  \n",
    "- Worker LLMs generate each section.  \n",
    "- Orchestrator merges results into a final essay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- Similar to parallelization but controlled by an LLM instead of code.  \n",
    "- More dynamic and adaptive.  \n",
    "- Closer to an agent pattern, but still constrained.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A two-LLM pattern where one generates outputs and another evaluates them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Generator LLM writes an essay.  \n",
    "- Evaluator LLM reviews it for grammar, accuracy, and logic.  \n",
    "- If accepted → Output finalized.  \n",
    "- If rejected → Feedback returned → Generator improves the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**  \n",
    "- Feedback loop improves quality and reliability.  \n",
    "- Increases accuracy and predictability.  \n",
    "- Widely used in production systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Quick Recap  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Chaining** → Step-by-step workflow.  \n",
    "- **Routing** → Choose the right expert model.  \n",
    "- **Parallelization** → Tasks executed at the same time (managed by code).  \n",
    "- **Orchestrator-Worker** → LLM manages workers dynamically.  \n",
    "- **Evaluator-Optimizer** → Generator + Evaluator loop for refinement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Takeaway  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI Agents** extend LLMs with reasoning, planning, and action-taking abilities.  \n",
    "- **Workflow patterns** provide structured methods to coordinate LLMs effectively.  \n",
    "- Together, they enable the creation of powerful AI systems that are accurate, efficient, and suitable for real-world applications.  \n"
